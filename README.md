## Sample apps

* [JavaScript/TypeScript backend](https://github.com/fauna/js-sample-app) - This sample app shows how to use Fauna in a production application.
The app uses Node.js and the Fauna v10 JavaScript driver to create HTTP API endpoints for an e-commerce store. You can use the app's API endpoints to manage products, customers, and orders for the store.
* [Java](https://github.com/fauna/java-sample-app) - This sample app shows how to use Fauna in a production application.
The app uses Java 17 with Gradle 8.9 and the Fauna v10 JVM driver to create HTTP API endpoints for an e-commerce store. You can use the app's API endpoints to manage products, customers, and orders for the store.

### Database concept videos
* [Webinar: Comparing Distributed Transaction Architectures for the Cloud Era (Kyle Kingsbury)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_zYYF3-iSo&t=2628s) - Geographically distributed transactional workloads are an emerging problem in distributed databases. Consensus algorithms like Raft offer us totally ordered operations in the context of a single replication group, but there is (as of yet) no consensus on how to build fast, isolated transactions across multiple consensus groups. Kyle Kingsbury, author of the famous Jepsen testing series, presents several approaches for transactional databases, including those based on Percolator (TiDB), Spanner (CockroachDB), MongoDB, Yugabyte and Calvin (Fauna).
